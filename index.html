              <h3>Sculpting</h3>
              <p>
                Sculpting is more than just a fun activity - it's an important
                part of a child's development. Children learn to use their
                imagination and become inventive. It helps develop motor skills
                that also assist with writing and other skills. Children learn
                to communicate as they describe what theyâ€™ve created. Sculpting
                encourages kids to problem-solve and discover the effects of
                their actions. To start expressing their creativity from a young
                age a sculpting is one of the fun ways to achieve this.
